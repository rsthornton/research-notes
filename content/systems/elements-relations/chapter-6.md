# Chapter 6 - Science, Religion, Politics

- [[unity of science requires an exact and scientific metaphysics]]
- [[physics must be displaced by biology as the science most relevant to our worldview]]
- [[the philosophy of biology must correct the denial of progress and overemphasis on randomness distorting our understanding of evolution]]
- [[we should think of the world in terms of - matter, energy, information, utility along with structure, function and history]]
- [[meaning is possible because our world is neither totally random nor determined]]


- [[the systems project is already the major interdisciplinary movement in the sciences]]
- [[the most valuable contributions of the systems project are in metaphysical clarifications of problems]]
- [[systems knowledge is about form and process in general, everything we relate to exemplifies a systems theme]]
- [[there are universal structures and processes common to many different types of systems]]
- [[the ESM of the systems project doesn't make claims of completeness, consistency , or certainty. it only insists on ubiquitous and important discoverable patterns in the world.]]


- [[an ESM would be a resource for wisdom]]
- [[a general model of process can be described]]
- [[while systems theory is biocentric, systems analysis is anthropocentric since humans are the only agents capable of perfecting]]


- [[a theory of global society that accounts for structural and functional views would be desirable]]
- [[a systems ontology of problems sees them as emerging from complex situations]]
- [[existing links in modern social systems may be non-ideal in type, direction, and magnitude]]
- [[in social systems information descends while matter-energy ascends]]
- [[society needs institutions dedicated to impartial scientific analysis of critical problems]]


- [[economic theory should highlight scale-dependence of the proper relation between polity and economy]]
- [[the polity should regulate the economy]]


- [[constructivist camps stress the relativity of models]]
- [[systems theory is too abstract to offer solutions to concrete real-world problems]]


- [[incompleteness is the most general explanation for evil]]
- [[humanity needs to accomplish a completion-reinitiation event]]


- [[a physics based TOE would add nothing to our understanding of life and human society]]
- [[the triple sustainability concept is imperfect]]
