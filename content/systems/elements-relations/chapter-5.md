- [[the various systems theories are not formally integrated]]
- [[we can identify four possible approaches to integrating systems theories according to a structural organizing principles]]
- [[we can view various systems theories as collectively defining systems science]]
- [[GST was meant to be a research program, not an individual theory]]

- [[synchronics and diachronics represent an attempt to integrate systems theory structurally, by organizing its content]]
- [[synchronics considers various system types in order of increasing complexity]]
- [[the most general is fundamental for systems theory]]


- [[an ESM should be developed first at the conceptual level]]
- [[one valuable contribution of the systems movement is  its offering of a systems theoretic language for discussing problems in general terms]]

- [[systems analysis usually doesn't deeply study divergence of actual from ideal]]
- [[viewing the planet as an organism is limiting]]

- [[biology links the microscopic and astronimic]]
