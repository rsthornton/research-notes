The equation to solve is \(x = 34 [f(x)]^2\), where the intersections are the points \((x, y)\) with \(y = f(x)\).

The function \(f(x)\) is periodic with period 4, and the solutions occur in the rising and falling intervals up to \(x \leq 34\).

There are 9 rising intervals (\(k = 0\) to \(8\)), each contributing two \(y\)-coordinates summing to \(1/34\), for a total of \(9/34\).

There are 9 falling intervals (\(m = 0\) to \(8\)), but for \(m = 0\) to \(7\), each contributes two \(y\)-coordinates summing to \(-1/34\), for a total of \(-8/34\), and for \(m = 8\), only one \(y\)-coordinate: \([-1 + \sqrt{4625}]/68\).

The total sum is \(9/34 - 8/34 + [-1 + \sqrt{4625}]/68 = [1 + \sqrt{4625}]/68 = [1 + 5\sqrt{185}]/68\).

Thus, \(a = 1\), \(b = 5\), \(c = 185\), \(d = 68\), and \(a + b + c + d = 259\).
