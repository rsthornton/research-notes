# Chapter 1 - Systems Fundamentals

### System Definitions and Structure
- [[a thing is an aggregate iff its state space equals the union of the state spaces of its components, otherwise it's a system]]
- [[a system's components must be listed before inquiring about its environment and structure]]
- [[understanding a system requires knowing its composition, environment, structure, history, and laws]]

### System Properties and Behavior  
- [[emergent properties are ones that are new for a system at a time step]]
- [[a system's degree of integration depends on connections or links among a systems components relative to disintegrating actions of the environment]]
- [[x and y are coordinated if they jointly contribute to the integrity of a system]]

### Connections and Relations
- [[a connection is a special type of relation that makes a difference]]
- [[the graph of the ancestry relation is a strict partial order]]

### Mathematical Foundations
- [[the concept of state space can be clarified with concrete examples]]
- [[a postulate outlining general systems principles]]
- [[the postulate regarding a system's optimal size is empirically testable]]

### Organization and Assembly
- [[self-organization is a special case of self-assembly]]
- [[the universe is the supersystem of all other systems, and a system composed of subsystems]]

### Methodological Approach
- [[the way to theoretical knowledge is from hypothesized structure to behavior, not from behavior to inferred structure]]

### Theoretical Gaps
- [[no theory specifies how conceptual items combine with concrete ones]]
