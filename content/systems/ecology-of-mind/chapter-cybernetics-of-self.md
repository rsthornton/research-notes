# The Cybernetics of 'Self': A Theory of Alcoholism

Bateson's groundbreaking analysis of alcoholism through cybernetic principles, exploring self-concept and systemic thinking.

## Key Atomic Notes

- [[aa encourages alcoholics to find the disease within themselves the way jungian analysts have patients find their type]]
- [[cybernetics recognizes "self" as part of a very large trial and error system]]
- [[differences, not impulses, travel in axons]]
- [[equating self with consciousness is a fallacy]]
- [[humans can't practically separate ontology from epistemology]]
- [[mental characteristics of systems are immanent in the whole, but not in some parts]]
- [[the world can't continue operating in terms of the cartesian dualism of mind vs. matter]]

## Core Themes

- Cybernetic understanding of self and identity
- Alcoholism as systemic disorder
- Mind-body dualism critique
- Systems thinking in psychology
